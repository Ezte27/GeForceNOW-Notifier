# GeForceNOW-Notifier
Are you tired of waiting endlessly in the GeForce NOW queue for your favorite game to start? Introducing GeForce NOW Notifier, a handy Python program designed to keep you in the loop and notify you when your gaming session is about to begin.  
  
GeForce NOW Notifier is a Python program designed to alleviate the frustration of waiting in long queues on GeForce NOW before playing your favorite games. The program notifies you through Telegram when your game is about to begin, allowing you to make the most of your gaming time.

## Features:
**Queue Notifications:** Receive Telegram messages when your game is ready to play, so you can join the action without constantly monitoring the queue.  
**Automated Process:** The Python script automatically opens the GeForce NOW app, searches for your requested game, and then enters the queue for you.  
**Windows 10 Compatibility:** Currently, the program is designed to work exclusively on Windows 10.  
  
## How It Works:
**User Input:** Specify your desired game through the terminal interface.  
**Automated Queue Process:** The program interacts with the GeForce NOW app, navigating the queue system for you.  
**Telegram Notification:** Once the queue is complete and your game is ready, you'll receive a notification on Telegram.  
   
## Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.  
Run the script on your Windows 10 system.  
Follow the terminal prompts to input your game preference.   
Wait for the Telegram notification when your game is ready to play.  

## Why I Created This:  
After enduring a frustrating 7-hour wait in the GeForce NOW queue, I decided to take matters into my own hands. GeForce NOW Notifier was born out of the need to eliminate uncertainty and let users know precisely when their gaming session is ready to kick off.   
  
## User Interface:
Currently, the user interface is command-line based, offering simplicity and efficiency. However, stay tuned for future updates, as we have plans to introduce a user-friendly web version for enhanced accessibility.  
  
## Note:
GeForce NOW Notifier is currently exclusive to Windows 10.
